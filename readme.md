# Google Foo Bar

[Google Foo Bar](http://foobar.withgoogle.com) is Google's secret recruiting process embedded within their search engine. There are 5 levels, each with a different number of challenges that follow a story.

Checkout [journal.md](https://github.com/n3a9/google-foobar/blob/master/journal.md) for the overall story with each level. 

Inside each level is a challenge folder with a problem file describing the challenge and constraints, and my solution to the challenge.

So far:

Level 1
- Minion Task Scheduling

Level 2
- Numbers Station Coded Messages
- En Route Salute

Level 3
- Queue to Do
